# Flappy Bird

This is a simple Flappy Bird program made by me in Pygame. 
If something's off it may be because I made this program with an IDE on my phone, yeah.

You can:
- [x] Flap
- [x] Fall
- [x] Die from pipes
- [x] Die from ground
- [x] Count your score
- [x] Beat your friend's highscore
- [ ] Die for carbon dioxide
- [ ] Move
- [ ] Go into the pipes
- [ ] Encounter Super Mario at score 999

I think that's all Flappy Bird is
